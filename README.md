## Thoughts on Communism

The above image is a Soviet Union Poster from the 1950s titled "Building requires knowledge. Knowledge requires study". This repository is inspired by the works of another Github user over [here.](https://github.com/r57zone/Thoughts-on-Communism/blob/master/Thoughts%20on%20Communism.md)

The current COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the internal contradictions of late stage Capitalism. That is the reason why the West has completely failed in mitigating the pandemic, thus showing all the systemic failures of neoliberal Capitalism. The scarcity we have is almost entirely artificial. Diamonds are actually pretty cheap, but production is mostly controlled by one cartel, and advertising jacks up the prices. Oil too is cheap, but the OPEC and other cartels suppress production to keep prices high. Stuff like insulin would be dirt cheap to produce, but patents artificially restrict that. Sharing software and data is super cheap, but copying/downloading certain things is not allowed to keep prices high. There is more than enough food for everyone, but then a lot of the food is wasted. Every capitalist argument boils down to something like this—“Systems other than consumerism have been tried, and they always fail. Not taking drugs always leads to withdrawal symptoms. All addicts are doing everything voluntarily, otherwise they wouldn’t have done it.” When you pay rent, you are not just paying the people who built & maintain the house (or taxes). You are paying for the passive income of the extraction rights of natural resources used, the real estate company, the bank that financed it, and so on. Capitalism does not eliminate poverty— if we look at the US, be it the incarceration rate, the suicide rate, the addiction rates, anxiety or depression, opioid addiction or other addictions, all of those are constant issues, on the rise. 

The problem with conservatives is that they merely see Capitalism as a form of exchange. But progressives see Capitalism more fully as a form of production. Under Capitalism we are forced to indulge in consumerism. As every business, small and large, must extract surplus value to make profit, every product is a result of exploitation (for instance, child labor), and thus, there is no ethical consumption. The U.S. is declining because it did not adopt foreign policies in a long-term horizon— much of its domestic tensions is due to its policies implemented abroad. Making short terms profits or capturing markets are purely selfish business perspectives. The competitive nature of Capitalism, and their idea of self-enrichment sets people against each other. The West was deeply tainted by their long history of exploitation. Compared to them, people in the USSR had an intrinsic goodness to them. Communism is as much a failed ideology as the hoe is a failed agricultural tool. At the time when we didn’t have horse-drawn plows and high-powered tractors, it carried the day for a lot of people at many places for a lot of time. If you walk around the countryside in the spring, chances are you’ll still see people picking the soil in their backyards and gardens with hoes. If you go and tell them that they use “a failed tool”, they will be puzzled. Just like the hoe, Communism has its uses. Under a very particular set of circumstances, it happens to work best. When inequality goes off the charts and nations split into bloody-minded packs, when students, housewives and bus drivers foam at the mouth and want to tear each other apart more than anything, State intervention is the answer. Because ultimately, rights come from government, not "God." 

Karl Marx predicted that if the abuses of unrestricted Capitalism went on, there would be revolutions by the working class. This was not a radical idea, because the French Revolution had already taken place when he was writing. Defending Capitalism isn’t owning the liberals, rather it is clinging to a dying system. But then why has Communism failed ? Ignoring the US-backed coups in the last 200 years, the main reason is that you  cannot fight Capitalism with a planned, centralized and stubborn political struggle. If religion is a system of human norms and values that is founded on belief in a superhuman order, then Soviet Communism was no less a religion than Islam. The Buddhist law of nature and Marxist laws of history are superhuman, since they are not legislated by humans. Yet they are not supernatural. And that's the problem with Communism/Socialism. The more you try to fight against private property, the more the enforcers of equality & social justice become the new “exploiters” by a Marxist definition. Then why am I interested in Leftist ideas? Because the value of a every commodity traded in the market has value only because labour has been abstracted in it. **And the task of tracing the genesis of this money form, developing the expression of value implied in the value relation of commodities, from its simplest, almost imperceptible outline, to the dazzling money-form, has never yet even been attempted by Bourgeois Economy**. As a Marxist, this task is set for us.

The above image is a propaganda poster from 1920 titled "Reading is one of the duties of man." The USSR in the 1960s-1970s provided a very steep growing curve for anyone with brains, ambition and a sense of higher purpose. And Stalin’s industrialization and universal education inculcated people with a huge respect for cultivation of intellect. The real purpose of Socialism is precisely to overcome and advance beyond the predatory phase of human development, economic science in its present state can throw little light on the socialist society of the future. And by merely existing within an economic system does not lead to an understanding of its flaws. This is a complex matter that requires time and dedication. And most people don’t spend their free time reading political theory, philosophy, economics and history.

The above image is another propaganda poster titled "Prison for the heart and mind." Religion is one form of spiritual oppression which everywhere weighs down heavily upon the masses of the people. The Soviet Union was the first state to have as an ideological objective the elimination of religion.  Even the bare mention of a citizen’s religion in official documents should unquestionably be eliminated to make it a private affair. And Soviet art existed with the sole purpose of making people better human beings and the world a better place. A big and mighty machine of the Soviet state relentlessly enforced this, and called it Socialist Realism. Maxim Gorky came to be the favorite novelist of Stalin in the genre of Socialist Realism. “Socialist” means your work has a distinctly political dimension. “Realism” means that your work is grounded in something that exists in reality. Maxim Gorkey articulated, along with a few other maverick Bolsheviks, a philosophy he called "God-Building" (богостроительство or bogostroitel'stvo), which sought to recapture the power of myth for the revolution and to create a religious atheism that placed collective humanity where God had been and was imbued with passion, wonderment, moral certainty, and the promise of deliverance from evil, suffering, and even death. God-Building was an idea proposed by some prominent early Marxists of the Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. It was inspired by Ludwig Feuerbach's "religion of humanity", and had some precedent in the French Revolution with the "cult of reason". Anatoly Lunacharsky, who was the People's Commissariat for Education in 1917, argued that Marxism was too mechanically deterministic with regard to human beings and that it alone would not be able to inspire masses of people. He claimed that while traditional religion was false and was used for the purposes of exploitation, it still cultivated emotion, moral values, desires and other aspects of life that were important to human society. And 'God-Building' was also ridiculed by Lenin, but Gorky retained his belief that "culture"— **the moral and spiritual awareness of the value and potential of the human self—would be more critical to the revolution's success than political or economic arrangements**. In contrast to the atheism of Lenin, the God-Builders took an official position of agnosticism.

We should really aspire to increase the scope and scale of human consciousness in order to better understand what questions to ask. The only thing that makes sense to strive for is greater collective enlightenment. This repository contains all the books and materials I have been reading which cover a wide range of topics like Economics, Business and Startups, Politics and History, Consciousness and Psychedelics etc. To sum up my thoughts, this is a quote from Lenin in his book "What is to be done":

> Every question runs in a vicious circle because political life as a whole is an endless chain 
consisting of an inﬁnite number of links. The whole art of politics lies in ﬁnding and taking as ﬁrm a grip as we can of the link that is least likely to be struck from our hands, the one that is most important at the given moment, the one that most of all guarantees its possessor the possession of the whole chain.
